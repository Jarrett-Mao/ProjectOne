My scene was a forest with a sunset in the backdrop. I included trees and other plants and some rocks. For my main character I chose a cute forest blob.
I was initially inspired from a scene in Everything Everywhere All At Once where there are 2 rocks with googly eyes. 
Unfortunately, I quickly realized that it was too hard to spot the googly eyed rock compared to the rest the rocks, so I opted for a cute forest blob.
